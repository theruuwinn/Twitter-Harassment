This project is on Categorizing Different Types of Online Harassment Language on Social Media. Twitter has a responsibility to take concrete steps and actions to address any human rights abuses occurring on its platform. According to information of internet source, It is unbelievable ! Women are harassed every 30 seconds on twitter. In our approach, our model first assure that the tweet is harassment or not, after that if the tweet is harassment then the tweets are classified into three different categories Physical Harassment, Indirect Harassment, Sexual Harassment. We created model using RNN and LSTM using Deep Learning and Neural Network approaches.
